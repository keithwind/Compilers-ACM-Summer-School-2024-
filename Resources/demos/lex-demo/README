The plan of introducing lex is as follows:

- Begin with minimal.l. Show that it echos everything on the output.
- Add the . rule to minimal. Show that it eats away everything other than newline.
- Use encode-vovels.l. Take the input vowel-input.txt.
- Use vovel-decode.l. Pine the out of encoding to decoding and have fun ;-)
- Use num.l
- Show kw.l, then kw-id-incorrect-*.l, and then kw-id-correct.l
- Show discarding-input.l.
